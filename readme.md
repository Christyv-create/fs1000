
Description:
The purpose of the website is to connect dog owners located  in the centre of Mississauga - Square One district, with local dog walkers. Square One area of Mississauga is a high density condo area, with many condo dwellers owning dogs. Condo owners do not have back-yards and must walk their dogs multiple times a day.  Local dog walkers can easily pick dogs up from condo units in this high density pocket of Mississauga, without the use of a vehicle. 

Note: For this assignment I used an image of a hamburger menu and the click here button is inactive as the assignment called for a static one page mobile responsive website only.  In further  assignments I plan to make the button lead to a subsequent page or form, and the menu to be functional as well.


User stories:
1. User of the service: As a dog owner I want to have easy access to local dog walkers in my neighbourhood so that I can book a reliable dog walker.

2. Employer and Provider of the service: As a dog walking service provider I want my website to be userfriendly, simple and accessible for clients seeking dog walking services, as well as dog walkers looking for work in the neighbourhood.

3. Dog walker: As a dog walker I want to be able to find local owners in my neighbourhood of central Mississauga so that I can walk dogs within a walking distance of where I live.
